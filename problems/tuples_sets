Unique Usernames

Write a program that reads from the console a sequence of N usernames and keeps a collection only of the unique ones. On the first line, you will receive an integer N. On the next N lines, you will receive a username. Print the collection on the console (the order does not matter):

Sets of Elements

Write a program which prints a set of elements. On the first line, you will receive two numbers - n and m, separated by a single space - they represent the lengths of two separate sets. On the next n + m lines you will receive n numbers, which are the numbers in the first set, and m numbers, which are in the second set. Find all the unique elements that appear in both and print them on separate lines (the order does not matter).

For example:

Set with length n = 4: {1, 3, 5, 7}

Set with length m = 3: {3, 4, 5}

Set that contains all the elements that repeat in both sets -&gt; {3, 5}

Periodic Table

Write a program that keeps all the unique chemical elements. On the first line you will be given a number n - the count of input lines that you are going to receive. On the next n lines, you will be receiving chemical compounds, separated by a single space. Your task is to print all the unique ones on separate lines (the order does not matter):

Longest Intersection

Write a program which finds the longest intersection. You will be given a number N. On each of the next N lines you will be given two ranges in the format: "{first_start},{first_end}-{second_start},{second_end}". You should find the intersection of these two ranges. The start and end numbers in the ranges are inclusive.

Finally, you should find the longest intersection of all N intersections, print the numbers that are included and its length in the format: "Longest intersection is [{longest_intersection_numbers}] with length {length_longest_intersection}"

Note: in each range, there will always be intersection. If there are two equal intersections, print the first one.

Longest intersection is [6, 7, 8, 9, 10] with length 5

The intersection of [0-3] and [1-2] is [1-2] (length 2)

The intersection of [2-10] and [3-5] is [3-5] (length 3)

The intersection of [6-15] and [3-10] is [6-10] (length 5) - which is the longest

Longest intersection is [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10] with length 9



Battle of Names

You will receive a number N. On the next N lines, you will be receiving names. You must sum the ascii values of each letter in the name and integer divide it to the number of the current row (starting from 1). Save the result to a set of either odd or even numbers, depending on if the devised number is an odd or even. After that, sum the values of each set.

If the sums of the two sets are equal, print the union of the values, separated by ", ".

If the sum of the odd numbers is bigger than the sum of the even numbers, print the different values, separated by ", ".

If the sum of the even numbers is bigger than the sum of the odd numbers, print the symmetric different values, separated by ", ".

NOTE: On every operation, the starting set should be the odd set

First name: Pesho. The sum of the ASCII values is: 80 + 101 + 115 + 104 + 111 = 511. Integer divide the sum to the current row (1): 511 / 1 = 511.

Second name: Stefan. The sum of the ASCII values is: 83 + 116 + 101 + 102 + 97 + 110 = 609. Integer divide the sum to the current row (2): 609 / 2 = 304.

Third name: Stamat. The sum of the ASCII values is: 83 + 116 + 97 + 109 + 97 + 116 = 618. Integer divide the sum to the current row (3): 618 / 3 = 206.

Fourth name: Gosho. The sum of the ASCII values is: 71 + 111 + 115 + 104 + 111 = 512. Integer divide the sum to the current row (4): 512 / 4 = 128.

The odd set: 511

The even set: 304, 206, 128

The sum of the even numbers is larger, so we print the symmetric different values.
